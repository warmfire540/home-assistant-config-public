## /automations folder

This folder contains all of the automations I use.
As with everything, some things could still be optimized, but that's work in progress.

Each automation YAML file also contains a description, but here is a brief overview.

### /automation/cats

Automations for cat devices.

### /automation/lab

Automations for lab devices.

### /automation/lights

Automations related to lights.

### /automation/mqtt

Automations related to MQTT platform.

### /automation/tags

NFC tag automations. Far from finished, more of proof of concept.

### /automation/utilities

Heating, electricity and similar automations
