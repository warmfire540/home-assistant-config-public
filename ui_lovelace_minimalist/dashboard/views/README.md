# Views

The views directory contains all view-specific configurations for the dashboard, organized into three main categories:

## Directories

- `mainviews/` - Primary dashboard views for general categories
- `rooms/` - Room-specific views and controls
- `subviews/` - Additional specialized views and components
- `01-home.yaml` - Main dashboard configuration file

Each subdirectory contains YAML files that define the layout and functionality of different dashboard sections.
